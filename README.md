# Roadmap of the Process

This project automates the process of transcribing video content, creating subtitles, and embedding those subtitles into the video. Below is a detailed roadmap of the entire process:

---

## **Process Overview**

1. **Convert Video to Audio**  
   - The program uses **Whisper** to extract audio from the video file.

2. **Transcribe Audio to Subtitles**  
   - The audio is then transcribed into subtitles using **Whisper**.

3. **Embed Subtitles into Video**  
   - The program prompts the user to choose the type of subtitle embedding:
     - **Soft Embedding** (subtitles are stored as a separate file and displayed during playback)
     - **Hard Embedding** (subtitles are permanently embedded into the video)
   - Depending on the choice, the program uses **FFmpeg** to embed the subtitles.

4. **Generate Output File**  
   - After embedding the subtitles, the program creates the final output video file with the selected subtitle embedding.
